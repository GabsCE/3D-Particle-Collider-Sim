# 3D-Particle-Collider-Sim
A real-time 3D physics simulation built with Raylib in C. This project demonstrates sphere-to-sphere and sphere-to-wall collisions, featuring variable sphere sizes/masses, adjustable elasticity (coefficient of restitution), and dynamic adding/removing of spheres. Includes interactive camera controls and collision sound effects(a bit buggy).
